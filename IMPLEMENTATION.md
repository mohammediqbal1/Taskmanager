# Monthly Goals Implementation

I've implemented the Monthly Goals feature with the following components:

1. **HTML Updates**
- Added a dedicated Monthly Goals section with auto-generate option
- Added a new Modal for creating goals with custom/auto-generated milestones
- Added progress tracking UI elements

2. **CSS Updates**
- Added styles for Monthly Goals board
- Added styles for milestones and progress tracking
- Added responsive design elements for goals section

3. **JavaScript Updates**
- Added Monthly Goals handling in TaskManager class
- Added milestone tracking functionality
- Added auto-generation of weekly milestones
- Added progress calculation and updates

## Testing

You can now:
1. Click "Set New Goal" to create a monthly goal
2. Choose between auto-generated or custom weekly milestones
3. Track progress through the milestone checkboxes
4. View goal progress in the dashboard
5. Edit, delete, or mark goals as complete

## Next Steps

2. Add data export functionality
3. Implement recurring goals
